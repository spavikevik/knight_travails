# knight_travails
Given enough moves, a chess Knight can reach any position from any given starting position. This can be solved using a BFS graph traversal, which is what this project is.

Usage:
```
knight_moves([3,3],[4,3])
    You made it in 3 moves!  Here's your path:
    [3,3]
    [4,5]
    [2,4]
    [4,3]
```
